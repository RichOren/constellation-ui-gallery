# PDF Viewer Component
## React-Lib

The `PDFViewer` component allows you to render and interact with PDF documents directly within a React application. It leverages **React** alongside popular libraries such as **PDF.js** and **PDF-Lib** to provide a seamless, in-browser PDF viewing experience with standard controls for navigation, zooming, and downloading the document.

## Features

### 1. **Document Rendering**
   The PDFViewer renders PDF documents inside a React component using a iFrame rendering system. This allows users to view multi-page PDF documents directly within the web interface without needing additional software.

### 2. **Page Navigation**
   - **Current Page Display**: Displays the current page number along with the total number of pages in the PDF document.
   - **Navigation Buttons**: The component includes easy-to-use buttons for navigating between pages of the document.
     - **Next/Previous**: Navigate to the next or previous page.
     - **Go to First/Last**: Jump to the first or last page of the document.

### 3. **Zoom Controls**
   - Users can easily zoom in and out of the document to adjust the view according to their preference. This includes:
     - **Zoom In**: Increase the zoom level of the document.
     - **Zoom Out**: Decrease the zoom level of the document.
     - **Fit to Width/Height**: Automatically adjust the document size to fit the width or height of the viewer container.

### 4. **Document Download and Printing**
   - The viewer provides built-in functionality for **downloading** the document as a PDF file or **printing** it directly from the browser. This feature is integrated into the toolbar for easy access.

### 5. **Full-Screen Mode**
   - **Full-Screen View**: A button allows users to expand the document to full screen, providing a distraction-free viewing experience.

### 6. **Responsive Design**
   - The component is fully responsive, ensuring that it adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Whether on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, users will have a smooth viewing experience.
