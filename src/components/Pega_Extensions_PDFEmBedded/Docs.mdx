# PDF Viewer Component
## PDF.js & PDF-LIB

The `PDFViewer` component allows you to render and interact with PDF documents directly within a React application. It leverages **React** alongside popular libraries such as **PDF.js** and **PDF-Lib** to provide a seamless, in-browser PDF viewing experience with standard controls for navigation, zooming, and downloading the document.

## Features

### 1. **Document Rendering**
   The PDFViewer renders PDF documents inside a React component using a canvas-based rendering system. This allows users to view multi-page PDF documents directly within the web interface without needing additional software.

### 2. **Page Navigation**
   - **Current Page Display**: Displays the current page number along with the total number of pages in the PDF document.
     - **Next/Previous**: Navigate to the next or previous page.
     - **Go to First/Last**: Jump to the first or last page of the document.
